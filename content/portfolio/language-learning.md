## Language Learning

I have an ongoing interest in learning foreign languages. My approach tends to focus on understanding the underlying logic and grammar of each language.

### Languages Studied

**French**
Studied French language with emphasis on grammar rules and sentence structure.

**Spanish**
Explored Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation patterns.

**Russian**
Engaged with the Cyrillic alphabet, Russian grammar, and basic conversational phrases.

### Learning Approach

My approach to language learning is similar to my academic studies - I focus heavily on the underlying logic and grammar systems. While this provides a strong theoretical foundation, I sometimes overlook the practical application of the language in everyday conversation.

### Future Goals

* Improve conversational skills in studied languages
* Practice speaking with native speakers
* Expand vocabulary through reading and conversation
