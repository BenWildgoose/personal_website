## Computer Science and Mathematics Degree

University of Bath graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.

### Academic Focus

During my studies, I particularly enjoyed pure forms of mathematics in the realms of:

* Algebra
* Real Analysis
* Type Theory
* Proof Assistants

### Dissertation

My dissertation focused on the Lean proof assistant language. I worked on bringing a proof from asymptotic analysis and formalising it within Lean. This project provided valuable experience with:

* Formal mathematics
* Programming language theory
* Logic and semantics
* Type systems
