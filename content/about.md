I'm a graduate in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Bath. During my studies I enjoyed pure forms of mathematics in the realms of algebra and real analysis, but for the first couple of years of study this felt somewhat distant from the topics we would study in the computer science modules. Fortunately there was a bridge between these two subjects inside the world of proof assistants. The topic of my dissertation was on one of these languages, Lean, with the goal of bringing an proof from asypmtotic analysis and 'formalising' it within Lean. The underlying logic and semantics of such languages were also studied in a module during my final semester, which made sense of the complicated type theory that Lean relies on for checking if proofs are valid.

In my free time I enjoy reading, especially about religion and philosophy. Language learning is also something I've gained a lot from, having studied French, Spanish and Russian all to varying degrees. 

Being Christian is a central part of my life and I regularly attend my local church.
