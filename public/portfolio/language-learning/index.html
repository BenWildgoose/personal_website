  content="Language Learning
I have an ongoing interest in learning foreign languages. My approach tends to focus on understanding the underlying logic and grammar of each language.
Languages Studied
French
Studied French language with emphasis on grammar rules and sentence structure.
Spanish
Explored Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation patterns.
Russian
Engaged with the Cyrillic alphabet, Russian grammar, and basic conversational phrases.
Learning Approach
My approach to language learning is similar to my academic studies - I focus heavily on the underlying logic and grammar systems. While this provides a strong theoretical foundation, I sometimes overlook the practical application of the language in everyday conversation."
