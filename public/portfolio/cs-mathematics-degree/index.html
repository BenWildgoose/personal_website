University of Bath graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Academic Focus
During my studies, I particularly enjoyed pure forms of mathematics in the realms of:

Algebra
Real Analysis
Type Theory
Proof Assistants

Dissertation
My dissertation focused on the Lean proof assistant language. I worked on bringing a proof from asymptotic analysis and formalising it within Lean. This project provided valuable experience with:"
